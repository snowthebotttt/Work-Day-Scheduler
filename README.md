# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For Challenge 5 of the boot camp, you were tasked with finishing the creation of a work day scheduler that allows someone to easily keep track of their schedule throughout the day. The scheduler displays the current date at the top of the page and includes time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, and the user can enter an event for each time block. When the user clicks the save button, the event is saved to local storage so that it persists even if the page is refreshed. The goal of the project was to utilize JavaScript, jQuery, and Day.js to create a dynamic and functional work day scheduler.
